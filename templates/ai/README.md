# Rust AI Application Template

This template provides a foundation for building AI applications in Rust with various inference capabilities, including large language models, image generation, speech recognition, and more.

## Features

- Multiple AI model integrations
- Inference capabilities for various AI tasks
- Efficient tensor operations with ndarray
- Serialization/deserialization with Serde
- Tracing and logging infrastructure
- Benchmarking with Criterion

## Model Options

The template supports several AI model types:

### Large Language Models (LLM)
- Uses llm-base and Candle for efficient inference
- Tokenization with the tokenizers library
- Suitable for text generation, completion, and chat applications

### BERT Models
- Uses rust-bert for transformer-based models
- Suitable for text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering

### Whisper (Speech Recognition)
- Uses whisper-rs for speech-to-text capabilities
- Audio processing with hound
- Suitable for transcription applications

### Stable Diffusion (Image Generation)
- Uses diffusers-rs for text-to-image generation
- Image processing with the image crate
- Suitable for creative applications and content generation

## Getting Started

After generating your project with FerrisUp, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-project-name
   ```

2. Choose the AI capabilities you need and add the corresponding feature to your Cargo.toml:
   ```toml
   [dependencies]
   # For LLM support
   llm-base = "0.2"
   tokenizers = "0.14"
   candle-core = "0.3"
   candle-nn = "0.3"
   
   # For image generation
   diffusers-rs = "0.4"
   image = "0.24"
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

4. Build the library:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

## Project Structure

- `src/lib.rs`: Main library file with AI inference capabilities
- `Cargo.toml`: Project configuration with AI-related dependencies

## Customization

### Adding a Custom Model

To add support for a custom model:

1. Download the model weights or use a model from Hugging Face
2. Implement the model architecture or use existing libraries
3. Create inference functions for your specific use case

Example for a language model:

```rust
pub fn generate_text(prompt: &str, max_tokens: usize) -> Result<String, anyhow::Error> {
    // Initialize the model
    let model = initialize_llm_model()?;
    
    // Tokenize the prompt
    let tokens = tokenize(prompt)?;
    
    // Generate text
    let output_tokens = model.generate(tokens, max_tokens)?;
    
    // Decode the tokens
    let output_text = decode(output_tokens)?;
    
    Ok(output_text)
}
```

### Optimizing Performance

For better performance:

- Use quantized models (e.g., 4-bit or 8-bit quantization)
- Implement batching for multiple inputs
- Use GPU acceleration when available
- Consider model pruning or distillation

## Next Steps

- Implement your specific AI use case
- Add a CLI or API interface to your library
- Set up model downloading and caching
- Implement streaming responses for LLMs
- Add evaluation metrics for your models
